## We run on an affiliate

We may earn affiliate commissions when you use our website to shop from retailers. However, our commitment to you, the consumer, remains unchanged. We prioritize your satisfaction and only recommend products that we have thoroughly researched and tested ourselves.

We believe transparency is key to earning and maintaining your trust, so we want you to understand how we make money without much legal jargon.

When you click on a gift idea from our lists and make a purchase, sometimes the store you buy from gives us a commission. Of course, this doesn’t affect the price you pay.

As members of the Amazon Associates program, we earn revenue from qualifying purchases you make through our referrals. This works out well since many items we purchase are from Amazon. We also have a partnership with Etsy, which provides excellent gift options.

Please contact us if you’d like to feature your products on our site. We will gladly promote your best items to more and more customers!

## Do your affiliate commissions make you biased?

Actually, no. Along with selecting our best and affiliated items, we just focus on “how to make a great gift list” for readers. That’s our goal from the beginning.

In case you see many products from one site, just because they are the most suitable for a gift topic. It is a pity if these “too-good” gifts cannot be included, right?

## Ready to support 24/7

We are committed to supporting our customers and partners whenever any issues arise. We help you get the best gift and service in our power. Meeting your need is our pleasure!
